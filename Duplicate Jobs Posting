### https://datalemur.com/questions/duplicate-job-listings

-- Find duplicate Job positing, We can say that when we see a job positing again its considered as duplicate Job posting
-- count(job_id) and then group by company_id, title, description (cuz all dup job positing will have same company_id, title, description)
-- Convert previous query to CTE and then write a query to filter out posting_counts =1 and then apply distinct count on positng_counts to get unique companies count

WITH duplicate_posting as (
SELECT 
    COUNT(job_id) as posting_counts,
    company_id,
    title,
    description
FROM job_listings
GROUP BY company_id,
         title,
         description
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT posting_counts) as duplicate_companies
FROM duplicate_posting
WHERE posting_counts > 1
