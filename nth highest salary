CREATE function getNthHighestSalary(n INT) RETURNS INT 
BEGIN 
SET n = n -1;
RETURN 
    (
        SELECT salary FROM Employee
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET n
    );
END

if n = 6  ie 2
    n = n -1 ie n = 6-1 = 5
    offset = n = 5 so it will remove top 5 salary and as limit it 1 it will rerurn 6th highest salary
